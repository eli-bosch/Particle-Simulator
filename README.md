# Basic Physics Simulator 
To run the code, simply use the following command
```
./build.bat
```
and follow the terminal prompts.

## For New Simulations
You'll have to manually change the Model.java code.

## For Playback of Provided Simulations
You'll have to unzip the simulation folders and place the new folder in the Particle Simulator directory.
Run the code, and follow the terminal prompts for playback.

## Future Plans
This project was a great opportunity to learn more about multithreading, but, in the future, I plan on adapting this code to a more computationally aligned language like C++. Most likely this code will be vector based with tree-based spatial partitioning and dynamic thread allocation.
